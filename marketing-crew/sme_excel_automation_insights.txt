Based on general knowledge and understanding of SME needs and pain points, here are some potential features and pain points: 

Potential Features for an AI-powered Excel Automation Tool for SMEs (under Rs. 50,000):

* **Data Entry Automation:**  Automated data entry from various sources (e.g., forms, databases).  Focus on common SME tasks like inventory tracking, customer data management, and sales records. 
* **Spreadsheet Cleanup and Formatting:** Tools that automatically clean messy data, correct formatting errors, and standardize data entry. 
* **Basic Reporting and Visualization:**  Simple reporting capabilities (summaries, counts, basic charts) to help SMEs quickly analyze data.
* **Integration with Existing Systems:**  Ability to connect to common SME business tools and databases.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Intuitive design for ease of use and quick learning curve.

Potential Pain Points for SMEs with Spreadsheet Tasks:

* **Data Entry Errors:** Manual data entry is prone to errors, impacting data accuracy and decision-making.
* **Data Consistency Issues:** Inconsistent data format and structure across spreadsheets leads to difficulties in analysis and reporting.
* **Time-Consuming Data Analysis:**  Manual analysis of large datasets can be time-consuming, preventing SMEs from making timely decisions.
* **Lack of Expertise:** Many SMEs may not have dedicated personnel with advanced spreadsheet skills.

Examples of Existing Tools (Non-AI Focused, but Provide Similar Functionality):
